<font size="5" face="Georgia" color="gray">"There is a dog called Danbi</font> &nbsp;<font size="2" face="Georgia">who lives with beist. She is actually one of the evil. She looks like an angel when she is sleeping. Her secret mission from the evil group is to make beist to be not around his work laptop. But this time, she is just angry because she is so hungry and beist is deeply sleeping. Now, she did bite his nose twice. And she did bite the beist's challenge for many times. So, the binary is probably sort of messed up. You can't open it with IDA, GDB and so on. Now, beist has no idea know how to recover the binary and solve the challenge. Help beist! <b>The goal is to read key.txt file."</b>
